The DroneAnt™ by WirEng® can be used in mission-critical situations where RF interferences may cause you to lose control of your drone, or simply when your drone's operating range is not enough to satisfy your purposes. The DroneAnt™ by WirEng® is waterproof and can therefore be used on boats, or under severe weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, etc. The primary purpose of the DroneAnt™ by WirEng® is to drastically increase your drone's range, however the DroneAnt™ is also recommended to stabilize your drone's operation because it will provide your drone with a very strong and reliable signal at any height, inclination, and operating distance. The DroneAnt™ by WirEng® is truly compatible with any drone, because it truly supports every possible frequency (450 MHz to 6000 MHz) and, unlike other omni-directional antennas, it operates in MIMO configuration for maximum efficiency and therefore range. The DroneAnt™ by WirEng® is highly recommended in areas with many trees, such as forests, areas with obstacles of any kind between you and your drone, areas with many cellular phone towers and therefore with high interferences, heavily populated areas (because of the overlapping of hundreds of Wi-Fi signals), beat frequencies, etc. The DroneAnt™ by WirEng® includes four WirEng®'s marine-grade, fully stainless-steel MIMOMount™ for strict MIMO compliance and ease of installation.

The GigaMIMO-Plus-5G™ by WirEng® is the perfect solution for large and medium vessels, such as cargo ships, yachts, tanker ships, and cargo ships. The GigaMIMO-Plus-5G™ by WirEng® can also be used in areas surrounded by many cellular towers spread out in many directions, such as in highly-populated areas. The GigaMIMO-Plus-5G™ by WirEng® is also splash-proof and qualifies as a marine antenna because of its sturdiness and the employment of gold, stainless steel, and thick ABS plastic. The GigaMIMO-Plus-5G™ by WirEng® can also be used under severe weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, high wind, etc. The GigaMIMO-Plus-5G™ by WirEng® is truly compatible with any 5G/4G/3G modem, router, and hotspot because it truly supports every possible cellular frequency (450 MHz to 6000 MHz) and, unlike other omni-directional antennas, it operates in MIMO configuration for maximum efficiency and therefore range. The GigaMIMO-Plus-5G™ by WirEng® includes four WirEng®'s marine-grade, fully stainless-steel MIMOMount™ for strict MIMO compliance and ease of installation. The GigaMIMO-Plus-5G™ by WirEng® comes with WirEng® extended 2-year warranty. Patent pending.",

The Omnirial2-5G-4x4™ by WirEng® can also be used under severe weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, high wind, etc. The Omnirial2-5G-4x4™ by WirEng® is truly compatible with any 5G/4G/3G modem, router, and hotspot because it truly supports every possible cellular frequency (450 MHz to 6200 MHz) and, unlike other omni-directional antennas, it operates in MIMO configuration for maximum efficiency and therefore range. The Omnirial2-5G-4x4™ by WirEng® includes WirEng®'s marine-grade, fully stainless-steel MIMOMount™ for MIMO compliance and ease of installation. The Omnirial2-5G-4x4™ by WirEng® comes with WirEng® extended 2-year warranty. Patent pending.",

The Omnirial2-Plus-5G-4x4™ by WirEng® is also splash-proof and qualifies as a marine antenna because of its sturdiness and the employment of gold, stainless steel, and thick ABS plastic. The Omnirial2-Plus-5G-4x4™ by WirEng® can also be used under severe weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, high wind, etc. The Omnirial2-Plus-5G-4x4™ by WirEng® is truly compatible with any 5G/4G/3G modem, router, and hotspot because it truly supports every possible cellular frequency (450 MHz to 6200 MHz) and, unlike other omni-directional antennas, it operates in MIMO configuration for maximum efficiency and therefore range. The Omnirial2-Plus-5G-4x4™ by WirEng® includes WirEng®'s marine-grade, fully stainless-steel MIMOMount™ for MIMO compliance and ease of installation. The Omnirial2-Plus-5G-4x4™ by WirEng® comes with WirEng® extended 2-year warranty. Patent pending.",

Because of its ultra wide operating frequency range, achieved by ultra-precision micrometer finishing, the Comb4-5G™ by WirEng® can be used in virtually any application for cellular/data bands worldwide, with marvelous efficiency (nearly 98%) and reliability. The Comb4-5G™ by WirEng® works flawlessly between the ultra-extended bandwidth of 450 MHz to 6200 MHz, as long as it's connected very near identical antennas and with ultra-low loss, identical coaxial cables, such as the WRG400™ patch cable series by WirEng®. The connectors are 24K gold-plated N-female. Warning: The Comb4™ by WirEng® cannot be used on the modem/device side, as it is designed to operate on the antennas' side (in other words, you can't use it with multiple devices concurrently operating, but you can indeed use it for one device with multiple antennas). It operates by dividing the RF signal coming from a modem/router when the device is in the transmission mode, and by adding the received signals coming from the antennas with the device is in reception mode, states which continuously change ever millisecond or so. The Comb4-5G™ by WirEng® is made one by one with highly skilled craftsmanship and includes a four-year warranty period. Patent pending.",

The LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® patented design requires no installation since it matches connectors types of the great majority of modems/routers/hotspots (ExtAnt™ adapters by WirEng® are also available for the few non-compatible devices). The LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® supports every possible cellular band worldwide thanks to its exceptional 450 MHz to 6200 MHz ultra-extended frequency range, with nearly lossless operation (99% average efficiency). The LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® is ideal for areas where electric storms are common, but it is also recommended in areas that only experience lightning activity rarely, as antennas tend to attract lightning just as lightning rods do, especially when installed higher than other objects on the roof; nonetheless, even antennas installed on the side of a structure or on a balcony may be subject to lightning strikes, hence the LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® is recommended for every possible situation. Additionally, the LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® will short electric charges due to accidental contact with strained electric wires as well, as an added benefit. The connectors on the LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® are SMA Male and SMA Female.

The WRG400™ has a diameter of 10.3 mm (0.41 inches) which is almost twice as much as regular coaxial cables, and employs top quality plastics and metals to ensure ultra-low loss behavior and ultra-low total parasitic capacitance, for operational frequencies of up to 6200MHz, which means every possible cellular band worldwide. This latest version of the WirEng® WRG400™ series features 24K gold-plated connectors for maximum durability and near-perfect conductivity. A length of 10 meters (33 feet) of WRG400™ cable exhibits a typical attenuation of 1.0 dB at 500 MHz, 2.0 dB at 1700 MHz, 3.1 dB at 4000 MHz, and 3.9 dB at 6000 MHz. Coaxial cables within the WRG400™ series are also quite flexible and can be used indoors, outdoors, or even buried underground. Every WRG400™ main cable (patch cables excluded) includes a short SMA to SMA strain-relief cable to reduce the force exerted by the cable when connected to your device. Unlike economy cables, WirEng®'a coaxial cables feature extremely strong connections using multiple bonding points, and are made one by one with skilled craftsmanship, and individually tested for performance that meets or exceeds the declared specifications. Hence, WirEng®'s coaial cables are of industrial quality and can be used in mission-critical applications. The WRG400™ by Wireng® coaxial cables include a two-year warranty period.",

The WRG400™ has a diameter of 10.3 mm (0.41 inches) which is almost twice as much as regular coaxial cables, and employs top quality plastics and metals to ensure ultra-low loss behavior and ultra-low total parasitic capacitance, for operational frequencies of up to 6200MHz, which means every possible cellular band worldwide. This latest version of the WirEng® WRG400™ series features 24K gold-plated connectors for maximum durability and near-perfect conductivity. A length of 10 meters (33 feet) of WRG400™ cable exhibits a typical attenuation of 1.0 dB at 500 MHz, 2.0 dB at 1700 MHz, 3.1 dB at 4000 MHz, and 3.9 dB at 6000 MHz. Coaxial cables within the WRG400™ series are also quite flexible and can be used indoors, outdoors, or even buried underground. Every WRG400™ main cable (patch cables excluded) includes a short SMA to SMA strain-relief cable to reduce the force exerted by the cable when connected to your device. Unlike economy cables, WirEng®'a coaxial cables feature extremely strong connections using multiple bonding points, and are made one by one with skilled craftsmanship, and individually tested for performance that meets or exceeds the declared specifications. Hence, WirEng®'s coaial cables are of industrial quality and can be used in mission-critical applications. The WRG400™ by Wireng® coaxial cables include a two-year warranty period.",

The WRG400™ has a diameter of 10.3 mm (0.41 inches) which is almost twice as much as regular coaxial cables, and employs top quality plastics and metals to ensure ultra-low loss behavior and ultra-low total parasitic capacitance, for operational frequencies of up to 6200MHz, which means every possible cellular band worldwide. This latest version of the WirEng® WRG400™ series features 24K gold-plated connectors for maximum durability and near-perfect conductivity. A length of 10 meters (33 feet) of WRG400™ cable exhibits a typical attenuation of 1.0 dB at 500 MHz, 2.0 dB at 1700 MHz, 3.1 dB at 4000 MHz, and 3.9 dB at 6000 MHz. Coaxial cables within the WRG400™ series are also quite flexible and can be used indoors, outdoors, or even buried underground. Every WRG400™ main cable (patch cables excluded) includes a short SMA to SMA strain-relief cable to reduce the force exerted by the cable when connected to your device. Unlike economy cables, WirEng®'a coaxial cables feature extremely strong connections using multiple bonding points, and are made one by one with skilled craftsmanship, and individually tested for performance that meets or exceeds the declared specifications. Hence, WirEng®'s coaial cables are of industrial quality and can be used in mission-critical applications. The WRG400™ by Wireng® coaxial cables include a two-year warranty period.",

            "description": "The WRG400™ coaxial cables series is WirEng®'s answer to the significantly higher frequencies introduced by the cellular 5G LTE bands, of up to 6200 MHz. The WRG400™ has a diameter of 10.3 mm (0.41 inches) which is almost twice as much as regular coaxial cables, and employs top quality plastics and metals to ensure ultra-low loss behavior and ultra-low total parasitic capacitance, for operational frequencies of up to 6200MHz, which means every possible cellular band worldwide. This latest version of the WirEng® WRG400™ series features 24K gold-plated connectors for maximum durability and near-perfect conductivity. A length of 10 meters (33 feet) of WRG400™ cable exhibits a typical attenuation of 1.0 dB at 500 MHz, 2.0 dB at 1700 MHz, 3.1 dB at 4000 MHz, and 3.9 dB at 6000 MHz. Coaxial cables within the WRG400™ series are also quite flexible and can be used indoors, outdoors, or even buried underground. Every WRG400™ main cable (patch cables excluded) includes a short SMA to SMA strain-relief cable to reduce the force exerted by the cable when connected to your device. Unlike economy cables, WirEng®'a coaxial cables feature extremely strong connections using multiple bonding points, and are made one by one with skilled craftsmanship, and individually tested for performance that meets or exceeds the declared specifications. Hence, WirEng®'s coaial cables are of industrial quality and can be used in mission-critical applications. The WRG400™ by Wireng® coaxial cables include a two-year warranty period.",
