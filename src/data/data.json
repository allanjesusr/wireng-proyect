The DroneAnt™ by WirEng® can be used in mission-critical situations where RF interferences may cause you to lose control of your drone, or simply when your drone's operating range is not enough to satisfy your purposes. The DroneAnt™ by WirEng® is waterproof and can therefore be used on boats, or under severe weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, etc. The primary purpose of the DroneAnt™ by WirEng® is to drastically increase your drone's range, however the DroneAnt™ is also recommended to stabilize your drone's operation because it will provide your drone with a very strong and reliable signal at any height, inclination, and operating distance. The DroneAnt™ by WirEng® is truly compatible with any drone, because it truly supports every possible frequency (450 MHz to 6000 MHz) and, unlike other omni-directional antennas, it operates in MIMO configuration for maximum efficiency and therefore range. The DroneAnt™ by WirEng® is highly recommended in areas with many trees, such as forests, areas with obstacles of any kind between you and your drone, areas with many cellular phone towers and therefore with high interferences, heavily populated areas (because of the overlapping of hundreds of Wi-Fi signals), beat frequencies, etc. The DroneAnt™ by WirEng® includes four WirEng®'s marine-grade, fully stainless-steel MIMOMount™ for strict MIMO compliance and ease of installation.

Unlike other protectors, the LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® installs just a few inches away from the device (or on the device itself, when feasible), so it even protects against lightning strikes to the coaxial cables, and not only to the antennas. As long as the LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® is connected to a reliable electric ground, the LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng®'s state of the art circuitry will immediately short a lightning discharge into the household ground network when properly installed (reliable household ground connection required). The LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® patented design requires no installation since it matches connectors types of the great majority of modems/routers/hotspots (ExtAnt™ adapters by WirEng® are also available for the few non-compatible devices). The LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® supports every possible cellular band worldwide thanks to its exceptional 450 MHz to 6200 MHz ultra-extended frequency range, with nearly lossless operation (99% average efficiency). The LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® is ideal for areas where electric storms are common, but it is also recommended in areas that only experience lightning activity rarely, as antennas tend to attract lightning just as lightning rods do, especially when installed higher than other objects on the roof; nonetheless, even antennas installed on the side of a structure or on a balcony may be subject to lightning strikes, hence the LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® is recommended for every possible situation. Additionally, the LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® will short electric charges due to accidental contact with strained electric wires as well, as an added benefit. The connectors on the LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® are SMA Male and SMA Female. The LightningPro-5G-SMA™ by WirEng® is made one by one with highly skilled craftsmanship and include a two-year warranty period.",

The WRG400™ has a diameter of 10.3 mm (0.41 inches) which is almost twice as much as regular coaxial cables, and employs top quality plastics and metals to ensure ultra-low loss behavior and ultra-low total parasitic capacitance, for operational frequencies of up to 6200MHz, which means every possible cellular band worldwide. This latest version of the WirEng® WRG400™ series features 24K gold-plated connectors for maximum durability and near-perfect conductivity. A length of 10 meters (33 feet) of WRG400™ cable exhibits a typical attenuation of 1.0 dB at 500 MHz, 2.0 dB at 1700 MHz, 3.1 dB at 4000 MHz, and 3.9 dB at 6000 MHz. Coaxial cables within the WRG400™ series are also quite flexible and can be used indoors, outdoors, or even buried underground. Every WRG400™ main cable (patch cables excluded) includes a short SMA to SMA strain-relief cable to reduce the force exerted by the cable when connected to your device. Unlike economy cables, WirEng®'a coaxial cables feature extremely strong connections using multiple bonding points, and are made one by one with skilled craftsmanship, and individually tested for performance that meets or exceeds the declared specifications. Hence, WirEng®'s coaxial cables are of industrial quality and can be used in mission-critical applications. The WRG400™ by Wireng® coaxial cables include a two-year warranty period.",

The WRG400™ has a diameter of 10.3 mm (0.41 inches) which is almost twice as much as regular coaxial cables, and employs top quality plastics and metals to ensure ultra-low loss behavior and ultra-low total parasitic capacitance, for operational frequencies of up to 6200MHz, which means every possible cellular band worldwide. This latest version of the WirEng® WRG400™ series features 24K gold-plated connectors for maximum durability and near-perfect conductivity. A length of 10 meters (33 feet) of WRG400™ cable exhibits a typical attenuation of 1.0 dB at 500 MHz, 2.0 dB at 1700 MHz, 3.1 dB at 4000 MHz, and 3.9 dB at 6000 MHz. Coaxial cables within the WRG400™ series are also quite flexible and can be used indoors, outdoors, or even buried underground. Every WRG400™ main cable (patch cables excluded) includes a short SMA to SMA strain-relief cable to reduce the force exerted by the cable when connected to your device. Unlike economy cables, WirEng®'a coaxial cables feature extremely strong connections using multiple bonding points, and are made one by one with skilled craftsmanship, and individually tested for performance that meets or exceeds the declared specifications. Hence, WirEng®'s coaxial cables are of industrial quality and can be used in mission-critical applications. The WRG400™ by Wireng® coaxial cables include a two-year warranty period.",

The WRG400™ has a diameter of 10.3 mm (0.41 inches) which is almost twice as much as regular coaxial cables, and employs top quality plastics and metals to ensure ultra-low loss behavior and ultra-low total parasitic capacitance, for operational frequencies of up to 6200MHz, which means every possible cellular band worldwide. This latest version of the WirEng® WRG400™ series features 24K gold-plated connectors for maximum durability and near-perfect conductivity. A length of 10 meters (33 feet) of WRG400™ cable exhibits a typical attenuation of 1.0 dB at 500 MHz, 2.0 dB at 1700 MHz, 3.1 dB at 4000 MHz, and 3.9 dB at 6000 MHz. Coaxial cables within the WRG400™ series are also quite flexible and can be used indoors, outdoors, or even buried underground. Every WRG400™ main cable (patch cables excluded) includes a short SMA to SMA strain-relief cable to reduce the force exerted by the cable when connected to your device. Unlike economy cables, WirEng®'a coaxial cables feature extremely strong connections using multiple bonding points, and are made one by one with skilled craftsmanship, and individually tested for performance that meets or exceeds the declared specifications. Hence, WirEng®'s coaxial cables are of industrial quality and can be used in mission-critical applications. The WRG400™ by Wireng® coaxial cables include a two-year warranty period.",

A length of 10 meters (33 feet) of WRG400™ cable exhibits a typical attenuation of 1.0 dB at 500 MHz, 2.0 dB at 1700 MHz, 3.1 dB at 4000 MHz, and 3.9 dB at 6000 MHz. Every WRG400™ main cable (patch cables excluded) includes a short SMA to SMA strain-relief cable. Unlike economy cables, WirEng®'a coaxial cables feature extremely strong connections using multiple bonding points, and are made one by one with skilled craftsmanship. Two-year warranty included.",

The WRG400™ has a diameter of 10.3 mm (0.41 inches) which is almost twice as much as regular coaxial cables, and employs top quality plastics and metals to ensure ultra-low loss behavior and ultra-low total parasitic capacitance, for operational frequencies of up to 6200MHz, which means every possible cellular band worldwide. This latest version of the WirEng® WRG400™ series features 24K gold-plated connectors for maximum durability and near-perfect conductivity. A length of 10 meters (33 feet) of WRG400™ cable exhibits a typical attenuation of 1.0 dB at 500 MHz, 2.0 dB at 1700 MHz, 3.1 dB at 4000 MHz, and 3.9 dB at 6000 MHz. Coaxial cables within the WRG400™ series are also quite flexible and can be used indoors, outdoors, or even buried underground. Every WRG400™ main cable (patch cables excluded) includes a short SMA to SMA strain-relief cable to reduce the force exerted by the cable when connected to your device. Unlike economy cables, WirEng®'a coaxial cables feature extremely strong connections using multiple bonding points, and are made one by one with skilled craftsmanship, and individually tested for performance that meets or exceeds the declared specifications. Hence, WirEng®'s coaxial cables are of industrial quality and can be used in mission-critical applications. The WRG400™ by Wireng® coaxial cables include a two-year warranty period.",

The WRG400™ has a diameter of 10.3 mm (0.41 inches) which is almost twice as much as regular coaxial cables, and employs top quality plastics and metals to ensure ultra-low loss behavior and ultra-low total parasitic capacitance, for operational frequencies of up to 6200MHz, which means every possible cellular band worldwide. This latest version of the WirEng® WRG400™ series features 24K gold-plated connectors for maximum durability and near-perfect conductivity. A length of 10 meters (33 feet) of WRG400™ cable exhibits a typical attenuation of 1.0 dB at 500 MHz, 2.0 dB at 1700 MHz, 3.1 dB at 4000 MHz, and 3.9 dB at 6000 MHz. Coaxial cables within the WRG400™ series are also quite flexible and can be used indoors, outdoors, or even buried underground. Every WRG400™ main cable (patch cables excluded) includes a short SMA to SMA strain-relief cable to reduce the force exerted by the cable when connected to your device. Unlike economy cables, WirEng®'a coaxial cables feature extremely strong connections using multiple bonding points, and are made one by one with skilled craftsmanship, and individually tested for performance that meets or exceeds the declared specifications. Hence, WirEng®'s coaial cables are of industrial quality and can be used in mission-critical applications. The WRG400™ by Wireng® coaxial cables include a two-year warranty period.",

            "description": "The WRG400™ coaxial cables series is WirEng®'s answer to the significantly higher frequencies introduced by the cellular 5G LTE bands, of up to 6200 MHz. The WRG400™ has a diameter of 10.3 mm (0.41 inches) which is almost twice as much as regular coaxial cables, and employs top quality plastics and metals to ensure ultra-low loss behavior and ultra-low total parasitic capacitance, for operational frequencies of up to 6200MHz, which means every possible cellular band worldwide. This latest version of the WirEng® WRG400™ series features 24K gold-plated connectors for maximum durability and near-perfect conductivity. A length of 10 meters (33 feet) of WRG400™ cable exhibits a typical attenuation of 1.0 dB at 500 MHz, 2.0 dB at 1700 MHz, 3.1 dB at 4000 MHz, and 3.9 dB at 6000 MHz. Coaxial cables within the WRG400™ series are also quite flexible and can be used indoors, outdoors, or even buried underground. Every WRG400™ main cable (patch cables excluded) includes a short SMA to SMA strain-relief cable to reduce the force exerted by the cable when connected to your device. Unlike economy cables, WirEng®'a coaxial cables feature extremely strong connections using multiple bonding points, and are made one by one with skilled craftsmanship, and individually tested for performance that meets or exceeds the declared specifications. Hence, WirEng®'s coaial cables are of industrial quality and can be used in mission-critical applications. The WRG400™ by Wireng® coaxial cables include a two-year warranty period.",
